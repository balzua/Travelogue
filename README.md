### Description
This is a web app to log one's travel/vacation history and memorialize trips they took and things they experienced while on those trips.
A user can create a username and password, then log-in to privately access only their own information.
Users can save trips, with a name, location, and dates they travelled, as well as supplying a URL to an image to mark the trip, or optionally allowing an image to be selected based on the location they designate.

Within each trip, a user can create a list of events associated with that travel that they wish to log, along with the date of that event, the location, a description, and an image.

Users can also edit and delete both trips and events as necessary.

### How to use
Users can sign up or login at the top right of each page. *A demo account is also available with the username: demo and password: demo.*
Click the add trip button to create a new trip. Trips may be edited or deleted by hovering over the tile for that trip and clicking the corresponding controls. To view events for a trip, click the event's name.

While viewing a trip, events may be created with the "Add Event" link. Events may be deleted in the same way as trips. To return to the view of all trips, simply click "All Trips".
